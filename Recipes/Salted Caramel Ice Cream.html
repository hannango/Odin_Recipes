        <h3> Description </h3> 
        <p> This luxurious ice cream is the ideal balance of sweet yet salty and rich yet light. It's custard-based, which means you have to separate a lot of eggs (six), but the thick and silky results are worth a little bit of fuss. For something a little lighter, use more milk and less cream, as long as the dairy adds up to three cups. You can also cut down on egg yolks for a thinner base, but don’t go below three. Despite the rumors, making caramel is not hard, but it can be a little tricky. If this is your first time, make sure you have enough sugar for a second batch in the event your first is a bust. Also, remove the cooking caramel from the heat just before you think you need to to prevent burning.</p> 
        <h4> Ingredients </h4> 
            <ul> 
                <li> 1 ¼ cups granulated sugar </li> 
                <li> 2 cups heavy cream </li> 
                <li> 1 cup whole milk </li> 
                <li> ⅛ teaspoon fine sea salt </li> 
                <li> 6 large egg yolks </li> 
                <li> ¼ teaspoon flaky sea salt (such as Maldon) </li> 
            </ul> 
        <h4> Steps </h5> 
            <ol> 
                <li><p> In a medium pot over medium heat, melt 3/4 cup sugar with 3 tablespoons water, swirling skillet frequently, until sugar turns mahogany brown in color (it should be almost but not quite black). </p></li>
                <li><p> Add heavy cream, milk, remaining 1/2 cup sugar and the salt; simmer mixture until caramel melts and cream mixture is completely smooth. Remove pot from heat. In a separate bowl, whisk yolks. Whisking constantly, slowly whisk about a third of the hot cream into the yolks, then whisk the yolk mixture back into the pot with the cream.</p></li>
                <li><p> Return pot to medium-low heat and gently cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (about 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer). </p></li> 
                <li><p> Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cool mixture to room temperature. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight. </p></li>
                <li><p> Churn in an ice cream machine according to manufacturer’s instructions. Sprinkle flaky sea salt into base during the last 2 minutes of churning. Serve directly from the machine for soft serve, or store in freezer until needed. </p></li>
            </ol>
